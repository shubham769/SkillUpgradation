Problem 1 : Write a program using string interpolation and a list.
For example:  if the list is List(10,20,30,40) output should be 
0 = 10
1 = 20
2 = 30


Problem 2 Write a program to find the maximum element from list.
For example: List(1,5,2,9,7)
Output should be 9

Problem 3  Write  a program to get the nth Fibonacci number.
For example: Fibonacci series (0,1,1,2,3,5,8.....)
if n is 3 then it should return 2
if n is 4 then it should return 3

Problem 4 Write a program to sum of the digits of the product of numbers from 1 to n.
For example: For, n = 5
1*2*3*4*5 = 120
1+2+0 = 3
