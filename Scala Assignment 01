Some interesting things that you can try :
In Scala REPL, type 3 : followed by a tab key and see what methods can be applied

In scala you can multiply a String with a number tell  the output.

Scala Docs are a good way to see what the class is doing and get the description, try to go through the documentation 
to find out how to generate a random number and then convert it to Base36 value and try to do it.

Explore String functions like , take , drop, takeRight, dropRight and find out the advantages or disadvantages of using 
them over substring() function in String




For all these problems try to use Val

Problem 1 : Write a program using string interpolation and a list.
For example:Â  if the list is List(10,20,30,40) output should be 
0 = 10
1 = 20
2 = 30
Solution :
def Solution(list: List[Int])={
    list.zipWithIndex.foreach {
    case(element, indexes) => println(s"$indexes = $element")
}
}

Problem 2 Write a program to find the maximum element from list.
For example: List(1,5,2,9,7)
Output should be 9
Solution:
def max(a: List[Int]) : (Int) = {
  a.foldLeft((a(0)))
  { case ((max), e) => (math.max(max, e))}
}

Problem 3  Write  a program to get the nth Fibonacci number.
For example: Fibonacci series (0,1,1,2,3,5,8.....)
if n is 3 then it should return 2
if n is 4 then it should return 3

Problem 4 Write a program to sum of the digits of the product of numbers from 1 to n.
For example: For, n = 5
1*2*3*4*5 = 120
1+2+0 = 3
